# unitn-statistica-chrome-extension
A chrome extension for the statistic course on the computer science department of UNITN


Lots of students sent the wrong answer to the UniTN's statistic course's assignments because they accidentally clicked the SEND button and there was no confirming popup. I made this chrome extension that "modifies" the professor's site so that now when the SEND button get clicked a confirming popup appears and the student's average remains safe
